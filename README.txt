A simple game written in python 3.
Right now it is not a standalone and you need python 3 to run it. The latest version is preferable but this was made using python 3.6/3.7.
The goal is to move around your "submarine" and pop as many bubbles as possible to get the highest score before time runs out!
Also, getting a certain amount of points makes go to the next level!
Use the arrow keys to move. Press escape or backspace to quit the game.
It's currently in version 0.1.
